# Contributing to OpenMotor Hardware

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenMotor! It's people like you who make open-source hardware a reality.

### How Can I Contribute?

#### Reporting Bugs / Design Flaws
* Use GitHub Issues to report technical errors in CAD models, PCB schematics, or documentation.
* Provide clear steps to reproduce the issue or a detailed explanation of the flaw.

#### Suggesting Enhancements
* We welcome ideas for efficiency improvements, new cooling methods, or material optimizations.
* Please open an Issue first to discuss the feasibility before starting extensive CAD work.

#### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added or changed hardware designs, ensure you provide:
   - Exported formats (STEP, PDF) alongside source files.
   - A brief explanation of the change and its impact on performance (thermal, mass, torque).
3. Ensure your contribution adheres to the **CERN-OHL-W-2.0** license.

### Technical Standards
* **CAD:** Preferred format is STEP (for compatibility).
* **Documentation:** All technical descriptions must be in English.
* **Naming:** Follow our naming convention (e.g., `CIAG-125-25`) as described in the README.

### Code of Conduct
By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our professional and respectful standards of conduct.
